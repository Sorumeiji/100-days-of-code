# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started settting up my workspace to start coding my development website.

**Thoughts:** I designed my website in Affinty designer, got the website up and running and tommorow I will start writing the content in.
I need to have more of a set goal on what to accomplish. I think I can get a draft done tommrow, if I focus properly.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started on coding the header, sidebar and navigation and made a bit of progress.

**Thoughts:** I haven't worked with SCSS in a long time, but I easily got back into it. I started to closesly follow the design using.
CSS Grids. I think the hardest part will be getting the spacing correct like in the design, esp. in the first column.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the base header of Soru.Dev, I wiill be working on optimizations on Monday.

**Thoughts:** I was really excited that this turned out to be almost exactly like I designed the header. Now I am really excited for the rest of the website, just need to write out the media queries.
