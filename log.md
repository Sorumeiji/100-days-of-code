# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started settting up my workspace to start coding my development website. 

**Thoughts:** I designed my website in Affinty designer, got the website up and running and tommorow I will start writing the content in.
I need to have more of a set goal on what to accomplish. I think I can get a draft done tommrow, if I focus properly.
